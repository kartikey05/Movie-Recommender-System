# Movie Recommender System

## Overview
The Movie Recommender System is a Python-based application designed to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. Leveraging collaborative filtering algorithms and user-item interaction data, the system suggests personalized movie recommendations to enhance user satisfaction and engagement.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to provide tailored movie suggestions for each user.
- **User Interaction Tracking:** Tracks user ratings and interactions with movies to continuously improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Genre-based Filtering:** Allows users to filter recommendations based on specific movie genres of interest.
- **Top Picks:** Highlights top-rated and trending movies to users for exploration.

## Installation
To run the Movie Recommender System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/username/movie-recommender.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Create a virtual environment for the project (optional but recommended). See the [Setting Up a Virtual Environment](#setting-up-a-virtual-environment) section for instructions.
5. Run the application using `python app.py`.

## Usage
1. Upon launching the application, users are prompted to input their preferences and rate a set of initial movies.
2. Based on user ratings and interactions, the system generates personalized movie recommendations.
3. Users can explore recommended movies, filter by genre, and view additional details.
4. Interactions are continuously tracked to refine future recommendations.

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment
To ensure a clean and isolated environment for running the Movie Recommender System, we recommend using a virtual environment. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install `virtualenv` if you haven't already by running:
   ```
   pip install virtualenv
   ```
4. Create a new virtual environment by running:
   ```
   virtualenv venv
   ```
   This will create a folder named `venv` in your project directory containing the virtual environment.
5. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
6. Once activated, your terminal prompt should change to indicate that you are now working within the virtual environment.

With the virtual environment activated, you can now install the project dependencies and run the Movie Recommender System as described in the Installation and Usage sections of this README. Remember to deactivate the virtual environment once you're done by running `deactivate`.
